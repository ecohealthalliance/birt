# BIRT

BIRT is a geospatial bird migration analysis tool.  Users may search for a bird species and identify migrations patterns over a period of time.

## Pre-requisites

### 1. Setup the database
BIRT uses MongoDB and data from [eBird](http://ebird.org/content/ebird/).  The `birt-consume` [README.md](https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/birt-consumer/blob/master/README.md) provides instructions on parsing the eBird data and populating the database.

### 2. Install submodules
BIRT uses GNU `make` to install git submodules.  In a unix-like environment, change directories to the `app\` directory and run the `make install` command.

### (Optional) Update submodules
Once installed, it may be necessary to update the git submodule dependencies by issuing the command `make update`.

## Run
The run command can be issued by calling `make run`.  However, Meteor will need the `MONGO_URL` environment set.  This can be accomplished in one or two ways:

### a. Global environment variable
  ```
  export MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost/birt
  make run
  ```
### b. Inline prior to executing `run`
 ```
 MONGO_URL=mondodb://localhost/birt make run
 ```

## Launch client
To launch the client, visit the following URL in your browser:
  ```
  http://localhost:3200/
  ```
